# React Training Projects 01

This repo consists of my React.js based projects by following a course on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org). The tutorial itself can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8)

> I also took initiative and did some projects of my own. All of the projects are deployed on [Netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/) and respective project links are given below.

> I used [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) nextgen frontend tooling software to develop these React.js apps.
